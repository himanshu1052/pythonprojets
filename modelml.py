----> 1.Supervised
    a.Regression
    b.Classification
----> 2.UnSupervised

---->  Unsupervised M.L Techniques or problems will solve the problem by using Making groups Called as Clustering..
----> The Supervised techniques and problem will work on data set based on relationship...(K-Mean)


----> k-mean:-(Models to solve problems)=> k mean  is unsupervised Machine-Learning Technique which work on groups or data points by making clustering.... 

    
    




                                    a.Regression => The  Regression techniques will work on data set to find the relationship and plot the graph also predict future data....
                                    
                                           i}Linear-Graph:- The linear regression will find the relationship in between data set or datapoint and draw linear graph based on data set also predict new data..
                                           
                                           ii}Polynomial Graph:-Relationship between data set and data point but draw in form of curve
                                    
                                    b.Classification => 
                                    
                                                          i}Logistic Regreession=>   
                                                                  

----> Types of Models :




----> Descision Tree => The Descision Tree will help you to  make the descision based on the previous data set Eg.---> Status of student to get pass or fail.


----> Train & Test => The Train & Test is a technique to measure the performance or accuracy of Given Model.
